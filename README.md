# Seng371-Project

Your project question:
-Can we determine the hierarchical organization and the social structure within an organization from looking at the code and documentation.

Example: Can we see that someone high up in the company has as much influence in the project as their title suggests? 


Methodology (including the tools you expect to use)*
1) Documentation to determine the actual hierarchical organization, including things like comments on GitHub.
2) Gource to estimate the impact of individual developers on code 
3) Some tool to view each individual developer's contribution to the code. 

*4) It would be cool to have a tool to visualize interactions between developers.

Could compare 3 and 4 to potentially create a relationship between developer's contributions and where they are socially.

Codebases/Systems you will analyze*
Mozilla or Linux TBD

Project milestones
1) Run tools on codebase
2) Analyze GitHub statistics, and internal documentation/official website
3) Compare data
4) Summarize findings
