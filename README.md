 BY JORIN WEATHERSTON AND BRANDON LEECH

Project Question:

-Can we determine the hierarchical organization and the social structure within an organization from looking at the code and documentation?

Example: Can we see that someone high up in the company has as much influence in the project as their title suggests? 

Why its Important: (TODO add in why you think it is important, and could be of general interest to other software developers as well!)




Methodology and Tools

1) Documentation to determine the actual hierarchical organization, including things like comments on GitHub.

http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ant-dev/

https://github.com/apache/ant/graphs/contributors?from=2001-12-18&to=2002-02-01&type=c

http://ant.apache.org/contributors.html


2) Gource to estimate the impact of individual developers on code 

3) Some tool to view each individual developer's contribution to the code. 

*4) It would be cool to have a tool to visualize interactions between developers.

Could compare 3 and 4 to potentially create a relationship between developer's contributions and where they are socially.



Codebases/Systems you will analyze*

Apache Ant


TODO: * a list of the metrics you are collecting, justifying their use in
answering your question


Our Tool:
* a copy of your source code, and instructions on how people can compile
/ run your code


Results: TODO ( * these should be reproducible, so be sure to identify any magic that happened in the process of getting them!  * include raw results, aggregates, visualizations, you name it!)


Analysis of Results: TODO


Conclusion: TODO (   * an answer to your original question based on these data sources and your methodology * threats to validity * future work)


Project Management:


Milestones:

1) Run tools on codebase

2) Analyze GitHub statistics, and internal documentation/official website

3) Compare data

4) Summarize findings
